# üç≥ MIRA: An Intelligent data Agent

Hosted Link: [https://mira-ai-agent.web.app](https://mira-ai-agent.web.app)

**MIRA** is a powerful AI-driven data generation assistant that intelligently selects between different LLMs (Groq & Gemini) to produce structured datas. Designed with LangChain agents, Flask backend, and a Vite + Tailwind CSS frontend, MIRA is a full-stack showcase of modern agentic AI workflows.

## Sample Input and Output

### Input

**Instruction:** PREPARE TEA

### Output

To make a cup of tea, follow these steps:

1. **TYPE: SIMPLE INSTRUCTION**

   * Take teapot: The teapot is an essential object for making tea, so take it first.
2. **TYPE: SEQUENTIAL INSTRUCTION**

   * Take water then fill the teapot: Fill the teapot with water to prepare for boiling.
3. **TYPE: SIMPLE INSTRUCTION**

   * Heat teapot: Heat the filled teapot to boil the water.
4. **TYPE: INSTRUCTION WITH REASON**

   * Add tea leaves to the teapot because tea leaves are necessary for making tea.
5. **TYPE: SEQUENTIAL INSTRUCTION**

   * Wait for 3 minutes then strain the tea: Allow the tea leaves to steep in the water for a few minutes before straining.
6. **TYPE: SIMPLE INSTRUCTION**

   * Take cup: Prepare the cup to pour the tea into.
7. **TYPE: INSTRUCTION WITH PURPOSE**

   * Pour the tea into the cup if your intention is to serve the tea.

   * Add condiments such as sugar or milk to taste because adding condiments can enhance the flavor of the tea.

Available Objects = {Teapot, Water, Tea leaves, Cup, Condiments}
Valid Actions = {Take OBJ: DUR 1 minute, Heat OBJ: DUR 3 minutes, Wait: DUR 3 minutes, Pour: DUR 1 minute, Add: DUR 1 minute}

## üß† How It Works

1. User submits a data name and language preference from the frontend.
2. Flask backend invokes `run_agent()`, which builds a task prompt.
3. LangChain agent chooses the right tool (Groq or Gemini) and returns a response.
4. Evaluation metrics are computed.
5. Frontend receives the response and displays both data and performance.

## üì¶ API Endpoint

### `POST /generate-data`

#### Payload

```json

  "data_name": "Pasta Alfredo",
  "language_option": "English",
  "model": "groq"
}
```


---

> All scores are auto-generated using the `EvaluationMetrics` module in `mira/init.py`.

## üåç Deployment

* **Frontend** is deployed on **Firebase Hosting**
  üåê [`https://mira-ai-agent.web.app`](https://mira-ai-agent.web.app)

* **Backend** can be deployed to:

  * PythonAnywhere

> Make sure your environment variables are configured properly in the hosting dashboard.

## üìù Classification & Sequencing Prompt Integration

MIRA‚Äôs second agent utilizes a classification and sequencing prompt to transform raw instructions into structured, dependency-aware steps. Below is the sample prompt and expected output format:

```text
Stepwise Instructions with Classification

1. pick rice
   Required state: rice is available
   Resulting state: rice is picked
   Type: Simple Instruction
   Dependencies: none
   Consistency: N/A

2. pick beef
   Required state: beef is available
   Resulting state: beef is picked
   Type: Simple Instruction
   Dependencies: none
   Consistency: N/A

3. wash dish
   Required state: dish is dirty
   Resulting state: dish is clean
   Type: Simple Instruction
   Dependencies: none
   Consistency: N/A

4. cook rice in pot
   Required state: rice is picked, pot is available
   Resulting state: rice is cooked, pot is occupied
   Type: Instruction in Sequence
   Dependencies: Step 1
   Consistency: Yes

5. chop beef
   Required state: beef is picked
   Resulting state: beef is chopped
   Type: Instruction with Reason
   Reason: Prepares beef for frying
   Dependencies: Step 2
   Consistency: Yes

6. fry beef in fryer
   Required state: beef is chopped, fryer is available
   Resulting state: beef is fried
   Type: Instruction in Sequence
   Dependencies: Step 5
   Consistency: Yes

7. add rice to dish
   Required state: rice is cooked, dish is clean
   Resulting state: dish contains rice
   Type: Instruction in Sequence
   Dependencies: Steps 3, 4
   Consistency: Yes

8. add beef to dish
   Required state: beef is fried, dish contains rice
   Resulting state: dish contains beef and rice (beef fried rice)
   Type: Instruction in Sequence
   Dependencies: Steps 6, 7
   Consistency: Yes
```

### üìä Dependency Table Example

| Step | Depends On | Objects Involved | Classification          | Consistency |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | ‚Äî          | rice             | Simple Instruction      | ‚Äî           |
| 2    | ‚Äî          | beef             | Simple Instruction      | ‚Äî           |
| 3    | ‚Äî          | dish             | Simple Instruction      | ‚Äî           |
| 4    | 1          | rice, pot        | Instruction in Sequence | Yes         |
| 5    | 2          | beef             | Instruction with Reason | Yes         |
| 6    | 5          | beef, fryer      | Instruction in Sequence | Yes         |
| 7    | 3, 4       | rice, dish       | Instruction in Sequence | Yes         |
| 8    | 6, 7       | beef, dish       | Instruction in Sequence | Yes         |

```

These structured outputs are fed back into the LangChain agent to ensure clarity, dependency management, and consistency across generated data.q
