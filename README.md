# 🍳 MIRA: An Intelligent Recipe Agent

Hosted Link: [https://mira-ai-agent.web.app](https://mira-ai-agent.web.app)

**MIRA** is a powerful AI-driven recipe generation assistant that intelligently selects between different LLMs (Groq & Gemini) to produce structured recipes. Designed with LangChain agents, Flask backend, and a Vite + Tailwind CSS frontend, MIRA is a full-stack showcase of modern agentic AI workflows.

cd mira_agent
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Python)

```bash
cd api_agent

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Frontend Setup (React + Vite)

## Sample Input and Output

### Input

**Instruction:** PREPARE TEA

### Output

To make a cup of tea, follow these steps:

1. **TYPE: SIMPLE INSTRUCTION**

   * Take teapot: The teapot is an essential object for making tea, so take it first.
2. **TYPE: SEQUENTIAL INSTRUCTION**

   * Take water then fill the teapot: Fill the teapot with water to prepare for boiling.
3. **TYPE: SIMPLE INSTRUCTION**

   * Heat teapot: Heat the filled teapot to boil the water.
4. **TYPE: INSTRUCTION WITH REASON**

   * Add tea leaves to the teapot because tea leaves are necessary for making tea.
5. **TYPE: SEQUENTIAL INSTRUCTION**

   * Wait for 3 minutes then strain the tea: Allow the tea leaves to steep in the water for a few minutes before straining.
6. **TYPE: SIMPLE INSTRUCTION**

   * Take cup: Prepare the cup to pour the tea into.
7. **TYPE: INSTRUCTION WITH PURPOSE**

   * Pour the tea into the cup if your intention is to serve the tea.
8. **TYPE: INSTRUCTION WITH REASON**

   * Add condiments such as sugar or milk to taste because adding condiments can enhance the flavor of the tea.

Available Objects = {Teapot, Water, Tea leaves, Cup, Condiments}
Valid Actions = {Take OBJ: DUR 1 minute, Heat OBJ: DUR 3 minutes, Wait: DUR 3 minutes, Pour: DUR 1 minute, Add: DUR 1 minute}

| Metric                        | Value       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Average Progress Score (AS)   | 1 score     |
| Completion Speed (CS)         | 1 score/min |
| Task Completion Rate (TCR)    | 100%        |
| Average Completion Time (ACT) | 1 min       |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User submits a recipe name and language preference from the frontend.
2. Flask backend invokes `run_agent()`, which builds a task prompt.
3. LangChain agent chooses the right tool (Groq or Gemini) and returns a response.
4. Evaluation metrics are computed.
5. Frontend receives the response and displays both recipe and performance.

## 📦 API Endpoint

### `POST /generate-recipe`

#### Payload

```json
{
  "recipe_name": "Pasta Alfredo",
  "language_option": "English",
  "model": "groq"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "recipe": "1. Boil water...\n2. Add pasta...",
  "metrics": {
    "AS": 0.95,
    "CS": 0.98,
    "TCR": 0.92,
    "ACT": 0.87
  }
}
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* **AS (Accuracy Score)**: Correctness of output
* **CS (Clarity Score)**: How clearly the instructions are presented
* **TCR (Task Completion Rate)**: Whether the task is completed
* **ACT (Agent Confidence Threshold)**: Overall confidence of the model

> All scores are auto-generated using the `EvaluationMetrics` module in `mira/init.py`.

## 📝 Classification & Sequencing Prompt Integration

MIRA’s second agent utilizes a classification and sequencing prompt to transform raw instructions into structured, dependency-aware steps. Below is the sample prompt and expected output format:

```text
Stepwise Instructions with Classification

1. pick rice
   Required state: rice is available
   Resulting state: rice is picked
   Type: Simple Instruction
   Dependencies: none
   Consistency: N/A

2. pick beef
   Required state: beef is available
   Resulting state: beef is picked
   Type: Simple Instruction
   Dependencies: none
   Consistency: N/A

...

8. add beef to dish
   Required state: beef is fried, dish contains rice
   Resulting state: dish contains beef and rice (beef fried rice)
   Type: Instruction in Sequence
   Dependencies: Steps 6, 7
   Consistency: Yes
```

### 📊 Dependency Table Example

| Step | Depends On | Objects Involved | Classification          | Consistency |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | —          | rice             | Simple Instruction      | —           |
| 2    | —          | beef             | Simple Instruction      | —           |
| 3    | —          | dish             | Simple Instruction      | —           |
| 4    | 1          | rice, pot        | Instruction in Sequence | Yes         |
| 5    | 2          | beef             | Instruction with Reason | Yes         |
| 6    | 5          | beef, fryer      | Instruction in Sequence | Yes         |
| 7    | 3, 4       | rice, dish       | Instruction in Sequence | Yes         |
| 8    | 6, 7       | beef, dish       | Instruction in Sequence | Yes         |

```

These structured outputs are fed back into the LangChain agent to ensure clarity, dependency management, and consistency across generated recipes.
